In this tutorial I’ll explain you everything about the project while we code it together. I’ll show you the logic used, components, tips, and after when finished, you’ll see how to hack it to have some nice extra features.

The tutorial is divided in 4 parts:

[1 – Coding the Android Tutorial](https://bytedebugger.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/tutorial-1-line-follower-robot-with-android-and-arduino/)

2 – Coding Arduino Tutorial

3 – Android X Arduino Communication – Project finished

4 – Tips and examples on how to hack the project


The full project will cost something around $60.
